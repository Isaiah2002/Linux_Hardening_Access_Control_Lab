#Part 1: File Permissions
After using the command <ls -l> to check the permissions for my public and private files I get this output: -rw-r--r-- 1 isaiah isaiah  99 Dec 30 15:35 private.txt, and -rw-r--r-- 1 isaiah isaiah  32 Dec 30 15:33 public.txt
Both my private and public files look the same, it has the: permissons, user, group, file size in bytes, last time it was modified, and the file name. 
For both files: the user has read/write permissions, the group has read permissions, and others has read permissions. A numerical way to identify these permissions is by 644. 
I want to change the permissions of private.txt so not every has easy access to my secret message there. Using the least privilege rule I used the command <chmod 600 private.txt> or <chmod go-r private.txt> so that the only poeple with access to look at the file is the user(me). i got this output: -rw------- 1 isaiah isaiah  99 Dec 30 15:35 private.txt.
If any file permissions had the value 777 that means it'll look like "-rwxrwxrwx". This means that anyone can look at the file, modify the file, and execute the file. This is extremely not good becasue it gives attackers the chance to add malware, modify or encrypt files, and allows the attacker to possibly escalate their own access to other files and data
This has taught me that the way permissions stop attackers even after an account is compromised with malware is by limiting what that compromised account or malware can access following the least privilege rule. So even if an attacker gains access to your device's shell or account, they can't look at protected files or modify any configuration on your device. As a someone trying to protect your own data you're essentially limiting the blast radius.

#Part 2: Users and Groups
I added a new user called attacker to test access controls using <sudo adduser attacker>. Then I added a new group using <sudo groupadd securefiles> and add myself to the group using <sudo usermod -aG securefiles isaiah>.
Then I created a file called passwords.txt to add to the group securefiles while also giving myself ownership of the group using <sudo chown isaiah:securefiles passwords.txt>. Then I change the permission of the file to 640 using <cmod 640 passwords.txt> so that the people in the group can only look at the file and modify the passwords. After running <ls -l passwords.txt> I get this ouput: -rw-r----- 1 isaiah securefiles   40 Dec 30 16:47 passwords.txt.
I switch to the user attacker using <su - attacker> and I try to use the cat command on the copied path of passwords.txt and got the output: cat: /home/isaiah/workspace/Linux_Hardening_Access_Control_Lab/passwords.txt: Permission denied. 
This has taught me how group permissions work, how least privilege is enforced through multiple users, and how unauthorized users are blocked from files they can't access. 

#Part 3: Privilege Escalation & Sudo Abuse
This part I will simulate how an attacker can abuse sudo privileges and gain access to passwords. Assume the attacker does not already have a shell, does not have access to sudo, and the attacker is looking for paths to excalate their privileges.
I which to the user attacker and check if the attacker has sudo privileges using <sudo -l> and I got the ouput: Sorry, user attacker may not run sudo on DESKTOP-8F1OJR0.
Say if I was to accidently misconfigure sudo rules/privileges for attacker using <sudo visudo> and adding in attacker ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:/bin/cat. This would allow the attacker to display the contents of any file without a password.
I switch back to attacker and run <sudo cat /etc/shadow>. Now the attacker can see password hashes allowing offline cracking of each user. 
To fix this vulnerability, as the user isaiah. I'll go back into <sudo visudo> and remove the line that said attacker ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:/bin/cat. I switch to attacker to test if he still has access to sudo privileges using <sudo -l> and i got the ouput: Sorry, user attacker may not run sudo on DESKTOP-8F1OJR0.
This has taught me that as someone trying to protect data you must be careuful of who gets permissions to do what and paying close attention of not creating misconfiguration for sudo privileges. I see how attackers can exploit these misconfigurations and access sensitive files. I also now know of a way to remediate the vulnerability of an attacker gaining access to data.
